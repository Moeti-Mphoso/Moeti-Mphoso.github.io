the idea behind this blog.

Reflexions is my number one habit that helps me improve and solve problems, it works mostly on my value of continuous improvement. This is the habit i most want to improve above all others, my hope for this blog is that it will cement my resolve and commitment to this habit, i have a tendency to slag on it and not reflect as much as i want, hopefully the social pressure of doing this will push me in the direction i know i really really want, in essence, I’m putting myself in a corner.

How i came about this decision:

systems above goals
on to reflections for this week:
Solving problems:

beyond the big questions of live about what we are doing here and the meaning of life and all that deep stuff, i believe our reality (whatever the answer to those questions) is to solve problems whose solutions leads to more problems to solve.

So recently i had a minute problem of having no comb after taking a shower at the jim, just as i was about to slide it away by just simply noting to myself to buy and bring a comb next time, i had the awareness that i have been having this problem for the previous 2 days, and had slid it just the same way, on reflecting - my awareness is that i do the same with all seemingly small problems (and goals) - i just come up with short solutions that i usually postpone and never really feel bad about because this are really small things, so i have this many small problems, a comb i will buy later, an overdue financial plan that i have been postponing  - its just a financial plan, trousers i still haven’t bought, a bed not made, a blog to start later, other minute problem, and a whole plethora of small problems that are queitly ruining my plans and peace of mind each day.

As a guy who profess to the idea of habits over goals (definitely going to write about this later - i promise I’m not postponing) my realisation and question for myself is, if i can’t “proactively” solve this small problems, how do i expect to solve the big problems - if i make a habit of solving small problems, just maybe, i can build the problem solving habit of proactivity, and have the capacity to solve big, time worthy problems that burn at my skull. after all, good advice suggests starting habits, maybe a company by making goals that are ridiculously small that one cannot fail. all big things are made of small things, one must learn to eat an elephant, if they are to achieve anything of great significance.

small problems must be solved - after all , problem solving is a habit one must have to address the reality of life.

To know and not to do is really not to know. The great aim of education is not knowledge but action - we know so much that we could use to improve upon our lives, yet we seemingly continue each day with misery and wanting, yet never apply that knowledge, postpone things for later give ourselves seemingly reasonable excuses and pad our backs, and eventually forget, live as though we will live forever. what a waste!

It is my resolve this week, after all, everything i learn is to help me solve some problems

You cannot runaway from weakness, you have to root it out, or perish, and if it be so, then why not now.

The first real solution to our problems is to examine our paradigms & attitudes towards them.

State - story - strategy

Start where you stand - tools

While it may seem small, the ripple effects of small things is extraordinary. Matt Bevin
