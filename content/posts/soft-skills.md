the soft skills that matter (not selling you things you don't need, or bullshiting, or faking it till you make it)
saying no (dnt be compromised)
honesty
being prepared and practised
proactivity & active engagement (honest engagement)
energy management
eliciting participation/contribution/energy out of others (tactics)
courage
minding your why (having an agenda)
- when the organization fails, you don't necessarily fail, and when it succeeds, you don't necessarily succeed
- don't have the organization forge a career path for you - the organization will attempt at every turn to convince you that its goals for you are your goals - fight this, daily: define your own goals, independentely (don't refuse opportunities or paths to your goal that were not visible before hand).

you cannot become more effect than your habits & training/practises

ownership: its amazing how even seemingly small tasks will not be done if there's no clear ownership

don't get your identity tired/wrapped up in your work

maintain a mission to become inadequate & get to work - ego is the enemy
