Career optimization
Ideal: To get paid a significant amount of money while applying the least amount of effort and obtaining maximal pleasure or fulfillment from my work.

## Significant ammount of money
- opportunities for this come in salary negotiation, this occur at job transitions, either new employer, promotion or job reclassification and counter offers (general salaries increase are just adjustments to the economy & don't count)
- How to optimize:
  - High skill, more specifically, convincing the employer you are highly skilled (evidence)
    - certification
    - references (past projects, name dropping)
  - Evidence work much more convincing, less expensive & pleasing
    - write white papers, journals & develop code.
  - negotiation: when going to an interview, be super prepared.
  - increase the negoriations transitions, never spend more than 3 years without a negitiation transition
  - simple strategy:
    - get 1 certification a year, or one big one (degree) in 3 years.
    - write 2 papers a year.
    - develop 2 tools a year.

## Least amount of effort
- Being highly skilled in what you do (practise & learning - ultra-learning, what you already assume to be skilled at)
- Process & frameworks approach to work, avoids a lot of guess work
- Document your solutions and thinking processes (for reuse & evidence)
- Automate & master "usefull" tools in your field
- Master organizing & propery managing your environment
- Master what changes slowly, is reusable & extensible (SQL, Programming language - Python, Golang) (The reason i stay away from frontend coding & data science)
  - Code & design patterns
  - Operating Systems
  - Architecture
- Avoid extra work like the plaque
- Don't be seen (without being insignificant), being seen is not the problem, being overloaded is, it tents to come with the teritory. if you are going to be seen, it better be strategic. being known & appearing to be highly skilled is not necesarilly advantageous.
- Be part of the team.
