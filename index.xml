Reflexions is my number one habit that helps me improve and solve problems, it works mostly on my value of continuous improvement. This is the habit i most want to improve above all others, my hope for this blog is that it will cement my resolve and commitment to this habit, i have a tendency to slag on it and not reflect as much as i want, hopefully the social pressure of doing this will push me in the direction i know i really really want, in essence, I’m putting myself in a corner.</description></item><item><title>Compare Text Files</title><link>https://Moeti-Mphoso.github.io/posts/compare-text-files/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 08:50:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://Moeti-Mphoso.github.io/posts/compare-text-files/</guid><description>you find yourself having to compare 2 files, diff to the rescure, for merge conflicts setup diffmerge</description></item></channel></rss>
