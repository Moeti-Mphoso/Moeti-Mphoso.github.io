Reflexions is my number one habit that helps me improve and solve problems, it works mostly on my value of continuous improvement. This is the habit i most want to improve above all others, my hope for this blog is that it will cement my resolve and commitment to this habit, i have a tendency to slag on it and not reflect as much as i want, hopefully the social pressure of doing this will push me in the direction i know i really really want, in essence, Iâ€™m putting myself in a corner.</description></item></channel></rss>
